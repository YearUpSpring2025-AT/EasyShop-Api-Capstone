# üõçÔ∏è EasyShop ‚Äì E-Commerce API Capstone Project

EasyShop is a full-stack e-commerce API built with **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**. It includes secure login, JWT authentication, product and category management, and a shopping cart system. Users can filter products and manage their cart, while admins can manage categories and products. The application is tested with Postman and includes a working front-end demo.

## üí° Interesting Code Snippet

```java
String sql = """
    INSERT INTO shopping_cart_items (user_id, product_id, quantity)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE quantity = quantity + VALUES(quantity)
    """;

try (Connection connection = getConnection()) {
    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
    statement.setInt(1, userId);
    statement.setInt(2, productId);
    statement.setInt(3, quantity);
    statement.executeUpdate();
}
```

**What it does:**  
This SQL statement automatically increments the quantity if a user already added the same product to their cart. It combines insert and update in one efficient query.

## üß™ How to Test (Postman)

1. Use this login payload:
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password"
}
```

2. Copy the token returned from `/login` and include it in your headers:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-token-here>
```

3. Use this token to access protected endpoints like:
- `/cart`
- `/categories`
- `/products`
